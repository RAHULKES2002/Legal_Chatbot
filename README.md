# Legal_Chatbot
This is a simple Flask web application that utilizes ChatGPT, a language model, to provide legal advice based on questions related to the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The application uses BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for text embeddings and cosine similarity for matching user questions with IPC sections.
